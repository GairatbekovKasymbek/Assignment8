Project Description
This project is a Java-based program designed to model and manage different types of devices using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program includes a base class Device and three derived classes (Smartphone, Laptop, Tablet) to represent specific device types. A user-friendly JavaFX GUI has been implemented to enable users to add, view, and manage devices interactively.

This project demonstrates inheritance, encapsulation, and GUI development using JavaFX. The primary goal is to provide a simple tool for managing devices and showcase clean OOP design principles.
